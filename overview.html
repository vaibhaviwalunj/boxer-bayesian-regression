<body>This page is the root of the javadoc hierarchy for the BOXER
project.  Software produced by the project includes BOXER (a Java
library for online, anytime learning of polytomous logistic regression
models), as well as a number of auxiliary tool. Those include BORJ
(Bayesian Online Regression in Java), a standalone Java program that
runs machine learning experiments using BOXER.

<h3>Scenario 3.1</h3>


<p>
Like <a href="scenario-1p1a.html">1.1</a>, but if and only if the entire set of examples is valid with
respect to Suite Foo, user wants to update Discrimination definitions
<em>and</em> update training state of Suite Foo using these examples.


<p><strong>Implementation</strong>

<p>For simplicity, we assume below that the entire set comes in a
single "dataset" XML element, and we only care about the first
unacceptable example. We therefore use the simple method
ParseXML.validateDatasetElement(...) for validation.  Otherwise, you
can use ParseXML.validateDatasetElement2(...) as shown
in <a href="scenario-1p1a.html">Scenario 1.1(a)</a>.

<pre>
  Suite suite = new Suite("foo.xml"); // create suite...
  // add a learner to the suite somehow
  ....
  // get the suite's learner (assuming there is just 1)
  Learner learner = suite.getAllLearners()[0];

  // modify suite by any preceding definitional parsing etc
  ....                                
  // validate the set of examples from dataset XML
  // a "datapoint" element
  boolean isDefinitional = true;
  String f ="dataset.xml"; 
  org.w3c.dom.Element e = ParseXML.readFileToElement(f); 
  int n=ParseXML.validateDatasetElement(e, suite, isDefinitional);
  if (n &gt; 0) {
	System.out.println("[VALIDATE] The data set from file " + f +
        " appears to be fully acceptable as a training set in the current suite."+
        " It contains " + n + " data points");
        // now, parse the date with the "real" suite. Definitional parsing is
        // used, so the suite is updated as we go
        Vector <DataPoint> v = ParseXML.parseDatasetElement(e, suite, isDefinitional);
        // Have the learner absorb all examples from v. 
        learner.absorbExample(v);

  } else {
	 System.out.println("[VALIDATE] It would not be possible to parse the data set from file " + f +
         " as a training set in the current suite. Please see a warning log message for detals");
  }

</pre>	

<p>
<strong>Discussion.</strong>  One may want to say that "Since training
always updates Discrimination definitions, omitting updating of
Discrimination definitions is not an option", but with Boxer 0.6.003
(and earlier) versions this is <strong>not</strong>, strictly speaking, the
case. For example, one may have already has read a complete suite
definition from "foo.xml", and therefore feel that any
"non-conforming" discr:class label in the data set file may only be an
error. In this case, one can parse the data as above, but with 
<pre>
  isDefinitional=false,
</pre>
which means that no changes will be made to the suite, and all
non-conforming labels (i.e. ones referring to disriminations or
classes not occurring in the original suite definition) will either be
ignored, or cause an exception.

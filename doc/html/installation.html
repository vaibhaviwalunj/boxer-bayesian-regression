<h1>BOXER and BORJ installation notes - binary distribution</h1>

<em>Updated 2010-12-03</em>


<p>This document is intended for those users who have downloaded the
BOXER-and-BORJ binary distribution (the file
use-boxer-and-borj-*.*.*.zip). 
</p>

<p>If you have downloaded the source distribution (file
boxer-and-borj-source-*.*.*.zip, or source code from the Google Code
repository), and want to compile it yourself, please read the 
<a href="installation-from-source.html">Installation from source code</a>
instructions instead.</p>

<h2>What's included</h2>

<p>The BOXER+BORJ binary distribution includes the pre-compilied code
for BOXER, BORJ, and a few other applications (boxer.jar), some
thrid-party jar files, documentation, and a sample script for running
BORJ (tiny-sample/test.sh, or test.bat)
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<h3>JRE</h3>
<p>
BOXER has been compiled with Java 1.5, which means that you need this
version, or any later version of Java to use the precompiled BOXER
binaries. To run BORJ (or any other precompiled application that uses
BOXER) you just need the JRE. If you write your own Java application
to use BOXER, you need the full JDK to compile it, just as it is the
case with any Java progream.</p>

<p>If you don't know whether JRE/JDK is already installed, you can type 
on the Linux/UNIX command line,
<pre>
  java -version
</pre>
If the the Java interpreter (the program called "java") is already
installed and is in your path, you'll get a message from it, including
its version number.
</p>

<p>A suitable version of JDK would be e.g. the one
called <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/">Java SE 6</a> by
Sun.com. It as available for download, for several platforms, 
from <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Java SE
download site</a>, where it's called "java Platform (JDK)".
</p>

<p>As an alternative to downloading JRE/JDK from Sun.com, users of some 
some operating systems may obtain an implementation of JRE or JDK from the provider of their OS. For example, Ubuntu users can install JDK with 
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install  openjdk-6-jdk
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Naturally, if you already have full Java EE (which is JDK + some additional
libraries and tools) it would do as well.</p>

<p>If you want to use BOXER with an earlier version of Java than 1.5, you can
also download the BOXER source code and try to re-compile it with your
version; see the <a href="install-from-source.html">instructions</a>.</p>

<h3>Third-party libraries</h3>
<p>
To use BOXER and BORJ, you need external JAR files from the
Apache Xerces project: <tt>xercesImpl.jar</tt>
and <tt>xml-apis.jar</tt>. For the user convenience, we now (from
version 0.9 on) include these files into the BOXER+BORJ binary
distribution; they are in the same <tt>lib</tt> directory
as <tt>borj.jar</tt>, and should stay there. 
</p>

<p>For more details about the provenance of these files, see <a href="xerces.html">xerces.html</a>


<h3>C Shell and Perl</h3>

<p>The BOXER and BORJ binary distribution comes with a sample C Shell
script illustrating the command line for running BOXER. Practically
all UNIX/Linux machines have C Shell already installed.
</P>

<p>The BOXER sample data distribution includes a number of C Shell and
Perl scripts for running BORJ and other BOXER applications in a
variety of ways. 

<h2>Downloading and using BOXER binaries</h2>

<p>If you plan to use BOXER, but not to modify it, you only need to download the "BOXER binaries", i.e. a 
a Jar file containing compiled BOXER and BORJ code.

<p>This jar file can be downloaded from the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/boxer-bayesian-regression/downloads/list">download
section</a> on our Google Code project. As of the summer 2010, the most
recent version there is  <tt>boxer-0.8.001.jar</tt>

<p>Once downloaded, you can just add the BOXER jar, as well as the
necessary thrid-party libraries to your classpath. For example, if you run BORJ
(a BOXER application included into the BOXER distribution), the Linux/UNIX command line
may look like this:
<pre>
 java -cp boxer-0.8.001.jar:xercesImpl.jar:xml-apis.jar edu.dimacs.mms.borj.Driver ...
</pre>
If you have written your own application that uses the BOXER API, and your application's
main class is called  MyMainClass, then your command line may look like this:
<pre>
 java -cp   boxer-0.8.001.jar:xercesImpl.jar:xml-apis.jar MyMainClass
</pre>
</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you're using MS Windows rather than Linux/UNIX, you should use semicolon (;) rather than colon (:) between the components of the classpath in the examples above.
</P>

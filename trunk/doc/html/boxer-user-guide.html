<h1>BOXER User Guide</h1>

<p>
BOXER is a Java library for online anytime machine learning of
polytomous logistic regression models. It uses XML as the main format
for describing input data, but it is possible for the user to use API
in other ways as well.
</p>

<p>
To provide an example of using the BOXER API, as well as a convenient
way of using BOXER without writing your own code, the distribution
also includes a simple Java application named BORJ. BORJ has a simple
command-line interface that can be used to perform most BOXER
operations (such as creating, training, and applying a learner), which
makes it possible to use it from a shell script.  Please refer to
the <a href="api/edu/dimacs/mms/borj/Driver.html">description of borj.Driver</a>
for the overview of BORJ and its command interface.
<p>

<p>
The rest of this document provides general information about using
BOXER in a Java application. One should refer to the
appropriate <a href="api/index.html">API pages</a> for
individual classes for the details on using each BOXER class.  You can
also look at the use of various BOXER classes and methods in the BORJ
source code.
</p>

<h2>Building blocks of a BOXER application</h2> 

<p>
This section describes the objects that you most likely will deal with
when using the BOXER API.
<p>

<ul>

<li>A <a href="api/edu/dimacs/mms/boxer/DataPoint.html">DataPoint</a> is a description of an
object (example). As far as BOXER is concerned, a DataPoint is simply
a sparse vector, with a number of "present" features, and a numerical
value associated with each feature. For example, if your application
classifies text documents, it can describe each document to BOXER by
constructing a DataPoint whose features are terms present in the
document, and the value corresponding to each feature (term) is the
frequency (numbers of occurrences) of that term in the document,
possibly normalized in some way.

<li>A <a
href="api/edu/dimacs/mms/boxer/Discrimination.html">Discrimination</a>
describes a way to partition the universe of objects (data points) into
a set of classes (not to be confused with Java classes) which are
mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. In other words, each
object belons to exactly one class. Discriminations may be binary
(having just two classes) or polytomous (usually referring to more than
two classes, but we will allow the term to be used for 2 class
discriminations as well). For example, one might want to make classify
each of a set of mushrooms into one of the two classes, for instance
{"POISONOUS", "NON-POISONOUS"} or {"EDIBLE", "INEDIBLE").  Those would
be two alternative binary discriminations useful in different
circumstances. On the other hand, we could classify the mushrooms with
respect to a polytomous discrimination with three classes {"EDIBLE",
"INEDIBLE-BUT-NOT-POISONOUS", "POISONOUS"}.

<p>
In BOXER, it is possible to specify a discrimination extensionally, i.e.
by providing a list of the names of its classes. It is also possible to allow 
BOXER to discover some or all of the names of the classes in a discrimination by observing
them in data which has been labeled with respect to that
discrimination.  A BOXER Discrimination object allows several ways of
specifying the relationship between class names observed in data and
the classes that make up the discrimination.  It also allows specifying
the names of two classes, the "default class" and the "leftovers class"
which can be represented in the data in a special fashion.  For
more on defining Discriminations see ????. 

<li>A <a href="api/edu/dimacs/mms/boxer/Suite.html">Suite</a> is a collection of several
independent discriminations, each of which is meant to partition the
same universe of objects in different ways. For example, if you are
classifying a set of news reports each of which may be associated with
one or more country, or with no country at all, there be the total of
100 countries mentions anywhere in the document collections, you may
choose to use a suite consisting of 100 binary dicriminations: {"USA",
"NOT-USA"}, {"Canada", "NOT-Canada"}, etc. On the other hand, if you
know that each document in the collection deals with exactly one
country (or, you are just interested in the single "main" geographical
topic of each article), you may have a single (polytomous)
discrimination with 100 classes, {"USA", "Canada", "Mexico", ....}.

In BOXER, several properties may be associated with each suite, to
help BOXER interpret input data in more efficient ways.

<li>A <a href="api/edu/dimacs/mms/boxer/Learner.html">Learner</a> is a class that implements
a learning algorithm. The Learner class itself is abstract (i.e., you
can't have an instance of simply "a learner", rather than of one of
its concerete subclasses), while its concerete subclasses implement
particular learning algorithms. An instance of a Learner subclass thus
emobodies a partiucular algortithm, complete with a particular set of
algorithm parameters.

<p>
A learner is always associated with a particular suite; internally, it includes a number of so-called "learner blocks": learning models associated with individual discirminations from this suite.

<p>
Once a Learner instance is created, you can "train" it (provide it
with some labeled training examples (data points) to be "absorbed",
i.e. for the learner to modify its inner state based on them), or
"apply" it to a data point (i.e. to have the learner classify the data
point, using the model it has built so far). Training and applying can
be done any number of times, in any order.

<li>An optional set of <a href="api/edu/dimacs/mms/boxer/Priors.html">Priors</a>
conceptually controls a penalty term subtracted from the
log-likelihood that BOXER's PLRM learners maximize.

</ul>


<p>
All BOXER objects described above can be initialized based on a
description in XML format ("deserialized") and saved as an XML element ("serialized").

<h2>Typical data flow</h2> 

<p>
While one may use BOXER API classes in a variety of ways, this section
presents a likely sequence of operations in a typical use case. Most
likely, you will need to use all, or most, of them to get started with
BOXER.


<h3>Creating a Suite</h3>

If you know in advance the structure of the classification system that
you want to apply to the data (e.g., classifying documents into so
many classes based on their contents), you may start your interaction
with a boxer with creating a Suite describing the desired classification.
An easy way to do is by creating an XML file containing this description,
and reading it into BOXER:

<pre>
File f = new File("suite-definition-file-name.xml");
Suite suite = Suite(f);
</pre>

<P>
(There is also a similar constructor that takes an XML Element as
argument, instead of the file name).

<p>
See <a href="sample-suite-out.xml">sample-suite-out.xml</a> for a
sample suite description.

<p>
Alternatively, instead of reading an XML suite definition file, your
application may assemble a suite in runtime, creating an empty suite
first and adding discirminations one by one. For example:

<pre>
Suite suite = Suite("My_Suite");
suite.addDiscrimination( "USA", new String[] {"USA", "NOT-USA"}, 
                         "NOT-USA", null, Suite.DCS.Fixed);
suite.addDiscrimination( "Canada", new String[] {"Canada", "NOT-Canada"}, 
                         "NOT-Canada", null, Suite.DCS.Fixed);
suite.addDiscrimination( "Mexico", new String[] {"Mexico", "NOT-Mexico"}, 
                         "NOT-Mexico", null, Suite.DCS.Fixed);
</pre>

In the above example, you have created a suite with 3 binary
discirminations. Each one has 2 classes, one of which (e.g. "NOT-USA")
is marked as a default class, meaning that examples not explicitly
labeled as belonging to a class in the discirmination "USA" will be
interpreted as if they were labeled as belonging to the class
"NOT-USA" of that discrimination.

<p>
Or:

<pre>
Suite suite = Suite("My_Suite");
suite.addDiscrimination( "Country", 
          new String[] {"USA", "Canada", "Mexico", "Brazil", "Other", "None"}, 
          "None", "Other", Suite.DCS.Fixed);
suite.addDiscrimination( "Source", 
           new String[] {"Reuters", "AP", "New_York_Times", "Other"}, 
           "Other", "Other", Suite.DCS.Fixed);
suite.addDiscrimination( "Language", 
           new String[] {"English", "Foreign_language"}, 
           "English", "Foreign_language", Suite.DCS.Fixed);
</pre>

In the above example, you have created a suite with two polytomous
discriminations and a binary one. Each one has a default class (used
for interpreting examples that are not explicitly labeled) and a
"leftovers class". The meaning of the latter is the following: if an
example comes up labeled e.g. "Country:Peru", "Source:AFP", or
"Language:Spanish", it will be interpreted as if it were labeled
"Country:Other", "Source:Other", or "Language:Foreign_language".

<p>
It is advisable to explicitly describe all discirminations you will
use, in order to ensure that BOXER does exactly what you
want. However, it is also possible in some circumstances to have BOXER
learn about discriminations and classes by looking at labels contained
in the data sets it will read, and to create discriminations (or add
classes to existing discriminations) as it goes. This will be
discussed later.

<p>
It is also possible that an application won't need to create a suite
explicitly, because it is going to read a "learner complex" - an XML
element containing the description of a learner complete with the
suite it operates on; that situation is discussed below.

<h3>Supplying a set of Priors</h3>

<p>A set of priors can be associated with a suite. This should be done
after the suite has been created, but before learners have been added.
It will affect all PLRM learners associated with the suite. (In
practice, though, only TruncatedGradient learners - including the
Adaptive Steepest Descent method provided there - care for priors;
other types of learners ignore them).

<p>See <a href="api/edu/dimacs/mms/boxer/Priors.html">Priors</a> for more information on using them.


<h3>Creating a Learner on an existing Suite</h3> 

<p>
To do any classification, you need a Learner. You can create a Learner
from scratch as follows:
<pre>
File f = new File("learner-definition-file-name.xml");
org.w3c.dom.Element e = ParseXML.readFileToElement(f);
Learner learner =  suite.addLearner(e);
</pre>
The learner definition file should contain a <tt>learner</tt> element
describing the learner's type and properties.
See <a href="eg-learner-param-1.xml">eg-learner-param-1.xml</a>
and other XML files in the directory <tt>sample-data</tt> for examples
of learner definition files.
<p>

It is possible to create several learners using the same suite; your
application may do this if, for example, you want to compare
performance of different algorithms in a single run.
</p>

<h3>Deserializing a "learner complex"</h3> 

<p>
Instead of creating a suite and a learner separately, you can read a
single XML element, <tt>learnercomplex</tt>, which contains both a
suite definition and a learner definition (or even several learners on
the same suite). The learner definitions can contain just the
algorithm name and parameters, or they can also contain the complete
saved state of the learners. The latter would be the case if
the <tt>learnercomplex</tt> file has been produced by "deserializing
everything" on an earlier run of a BOXER application. This, in fact,
is the more typical use of <tt>learnercomplex</tt>.

<p>Reading a  "learner complex":
<pre>
File f = new File("learner-complex-file-name.xml");
suite =  Learner.deserializeLearnerComplex(f);
</pre>

<h3>Reading data points from an XML file</h3>
<p>
To feed a set of data points to BOXER (as a training set or a test
set), you will typically create an XML file (or an in-mememory XML
org.w3c.dom.Element object) containing a <tt>dataset</tt>
element. This element will enclose any number of <tt>datapoint</tt>
tags, each of which will describe a data point, i.e. the data point's
features and their values, as well as any discrimination/class labels
that may be associated with this. 

<p>
The data set description XML file can be read in using the
ParseXML class:
<pre>
Vector<DataPoint> train =  ParseXML.readDataFileXML("file-name.xml", suite, true);	
</pre>
The last (boolean) parameter affects how BOXER will interpret data
points' class labels that it cannot resolve via the discrimination
definitions it already has. If this flag is <tt>true</tt>, BOXER may
(if allowed by the suite's properties) add new discriminations and/or
classes to the suite based on such "unexepected" labels. Otherwise,
the only options it has is to ignore such labels, or to throw an
exception.  Therefore, you may want to either never have this flag on
(if you always provide complete suite definition in advance), or only
have it on when reading your training examples (since it makes little
sense to extend your discriminations when reading test data!).

<p>
Once read and stored as DataPoint objects, the data points can be used
just once, or a number of times - e.g., you can feed the same data
point to a Learner several times as a training example, or you can
later apply the Learner to it to see how correctly it will score it.
</p>

<h4>BMR-format data</h4>

<p>It is possible to read data points from data files in the
BBR/BMR/BXR format (same as
the <a href="http://svmlight.joachims.org/">SVMlight</a>format),
rather than the usual XML format. Since the data points' lines in this
format do not carry discrimination labeles (there is only one
discrimination, of course!), it is necessary to switch BOXER into the
SupportsSimpleLabels.Polytomous mode. For this, the appropriate flag
should be set on the suite, and the suite should contain a suitable
discrimination (a non-fallback non-empty discrimination with a default
class). A suitable suite can be created with a definition file similar
to <a href="WalletSuite.xml">WalletSuite.xml</a>.

<p>A sample BORJ command line for this:
<pre>
java  edu.dimacs.mms.borj.Driver read-suite:WalletSuite.xml \
read-learner:  tg-learner-param-eta=1_0-g=1_0-K=1.xml  \
train:../wallet/wallet.data.bmr test:../wallet/wallet.data.bmr:scores.dat 
</pre>

<h3>Creating data points</h3> 

<p>
While XML files are convenient for passing data between applications,
your program may create DataPoint objects directly as well. E.g.
<pre>
// get the FeatureDictionary associated with the current suite
FeatureDictionary fd = suite.getDic(); 
Vector&lt;DataPoint.FVPair&gt; v = new Vector&lt;DataPoint.FVPair&gt;;
for(....) {
  String featureName = ...;
  double featureValeu = ...;
  int featureID = fd.getIdAlways( featureName );
  v.add( new FVPair( featureID, featureValue);
}
DataPoint p = new DataPoint(v, fd);
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Training a Learner</h3> 

<p>
All BOXER Learners are able to accept additional training examples at any time.
The usual training method can process one or several examples.

<p>
To process an entire vector:
<pre>
Vector<DataPoint> xvec = ...;
learner.absorbExample(xvec);
</pre>

<p>
To process 2 examples: the i-th and (i+1)-th elements of the vector:
<pre>
Vector<DataPoint> xvec = ...;
learner.absorbExample(xvec, i, i+2);
</pre>
</p>

<p>
If your application generates data in XML format, it is also possible to feed an XML description of a data point directly to the Learner:
<pre>
org.w3c.dom.Element e = ...; // a <tt>datapoint</tt> element
learner.absorbExample(e);
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Scoring examples</h3> 

<p>
Applying a learner's model to an example:
<pre>
  Learner algo = ...;
  DataPoint x = ...;
  double [][] prob = algo.applyModel(x);
</pre>
In he result array, the element <tt>prob[i][j]</tt> contains the
model's estimation of the probability of the example <em>x</em>'s
belongingh to the <em>j</em>-th class of the <tt>i</tt>-th
discrimination of the suite with which the learner is associated.
<p>

In practice, many probabilities are very small numbers; in order to be
able to see them as different from zero, one can request the model to
return natural logarithms of the scores:
<pre>
  Learner algo = ...;
  DataPoint x = ...;
  double [][] probLog = algo.applyModelLog(x);
  // You can use probLog[][] directly, or compute exp(*) of each element
  double [][] prob = expProb(probLog); 
</pre>
<p>

If the DataPoint x has been read from an XML data set file, it will
also contain any class labels associated with it in the XML
file. Naturally, <tt>applyModel</tt> will <em>not</em> look at those
labels, and they (or the test example itself) won't affect the
learner's model in any way. But you can interpret those stored labels
as the "true" classification of the data poiint, and use them to
compute various measures of the classification quality (cumulative
recall, precisions, log-likelyhood). There are a number of auxiliary
classes and methods to do it; you can reuse a number of methods from
the <tt>borj</tt> package. Look at the source code of borj.Driverd,
and the auxiliary class <tt>borj.Scores</tt> for details.

<h3>Logging</h3> 

Boxer sends certain warning and info messages to a logger called
"boxer". To control the processing of those messages, you can create a logger with that name in advance, as follows:
<pre>
  String NAME = "boxer";
  Logger logger = java.util.logging.Logger.getLogger(NAME);
</pre>
and then configure the logger as desired. For more on logging, see <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/util/logging/overview.html">Java<sup>TM</sup> Logging Overview</a>.

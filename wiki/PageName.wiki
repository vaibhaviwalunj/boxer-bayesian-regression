= Introduction =

To put the code in, one apparently needs to install a Subversion (SVN) client locally. 
For an MS Windows machine, trying to get "CollabNet Subversion Client v1.6.3"  from here: http://subversion.tigris.org/getting.html#windows

= Details =

*Adding* a whole tree:
 * svn import src  https://boxer-bayesian-regression.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/  --username vmenkov   -m "Initial import"

_Deleting_ a file:
svn del  https://boxer-bayesian-regression.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/boxer/BXRReader.java.bak  https://boxer-bayesian-regression.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/boxer/DataPoint.java.bak --username vmenkov -m "delete bak files"

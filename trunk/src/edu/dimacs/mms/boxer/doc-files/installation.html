<h1>Boxer and BORJ installation notes</h1>

<em>Updated 2010-09-21</em>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<h3>JRE</h3>
<p>
Boxer has been compiled with Java 1.6, and that's what you need to
have to use the precompiled Boxer binaries. More precisely, you'll
need just the JRE to run Borj (or any other precompiled application
that uses Boxer), or the full JDK to compile it. If you're writing
your own Java code, then you must have the JDK already, of course.</p>

<p>If you want to use Boxer with an earlier version of Java, you can
also download the Boxer source code and try to re-compile it with your
version.</p>

<h3>Apache Ant</h3>

<p><a href="http://ant.apache.org">Apache Ant</a> is needed only if
you want to build Boxer and BORJ from source.</p>

<h3>Third-party libraries</h3>
<p>
To compile and use Boxer and Borj, you  need an external JAR file:
<ul>
<li>xercesImpl.jar: There are multiple sources on the internet (including the official site, <a href="http://xerces.apache.org/">Apache Xerces</a>), and if you've downloaded some of popular Java-based applications (e.g., Apache Ant), you probably already haver this file on. This library is essential for Boxer's parsing of XML files.
</ul>

<p>Once downloaded, you should locate the Jar file somewhere where it
would be included in your classpath. This will be explained in more
details below.

<p>
If you also plan to compile and use the Boxer's Blackbook adapter, you need the Blackbook jar files, and a number of third-party jar files, such those for Jena and Commons Logging; however, discussing this is outside of the scope of this document.
<!--
<ul>
<li>jena.jar: You can download jena-2.6.0.zip from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jena/files/Jena/Jena-2.6.0/jena-2.6.0.zip/download">here</a> and extract jena.jar from the archive. This library is only needed if you plan to integrate Boxer with Blackbook; you can easily do without it otherwise.
<li>http://commons.apache.org/logging/
 commons-logging-1.1.1.jar
</ul>
-->

<h2>Downloading and using Boxer binaries</h2>

<p>A Jar file containing compiled Boxer and BORJ code can be downloaded from the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/boxer-bayesian-regression/downloads/list">download
section</a> on our Google Code project. As of 2010-02-18, the most
recent version there is  <tt>boxer-0.7.005.jar</tt>

<p>Once downloaded, you can just add the Boxer jar, as well as the
necessary thrid-party libraries to your classpath, e.g.
<pre>
 java -cp boxer-0.7.005.jar:xercesImpl.jar MyMainClass
</pre>
(to run your own application MyMainClass that makes use of the Boxer API),
or
<pre>
 java -cp boxer-0.7.005.jar:xercesImpl.jar edu.dimacs.mms.borj.Driver ...
</pre>
(to run our small Boxer application, BORJ).
</p>

<h2>Downloading and compiling from source</h2>

<p>If you consider modifying Boxer code for your needs, or building
your own Boxer application using BORJ as a sample, you'll need to
download Boxer source code, and to build from source. This is easy,
thanks to Apache Ant.

<p>An advantaging of downloading the source code zip file is that it
also contains a number of example data files and the Javadoc HTML
(i.e., what you are reading now).

<h3>Downloading from Google Code with SVN</h3>

<p>You can get the most current Boxer/BORJ source code snapshot from
the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/boxer-bayesian-regression/">Google
Code site for our project</a>. To do this, you need to have a
Subversion client installed; on most Linux machines, it comes as the
pre-installed "svn" command; elsewhere, you may want to look on the
web for the SVN application you like.
</P>

<p>This is how to download the entire boxer-bayesian-regression source tree:
<pre>
  mkdir boxer
  cd boxer
  svn checkout https://boxer-bayesian-regression.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ boxer-bayesian-regression 
</pre>
You may want to add your Google Code username to the above command, e.g. <tt> --username vmenkov </tt>
</P>

<p>This will create on your host (under your current directory,
i.e. <tt>boxer</tt>) a directory named <tt>boxer-bayesian-regression</tt>, with
subidrectories named <tt>src</tt>, <tt>sample-data</tt>, etc.
</P>

<h3>Downloading a ZIP file</h3>
<p>Alternatively, you can obtain Boxer source code in a single zip file. If you're a member of the MMS.DEVELOP project at Rutgers, you can download a Boxer zip file from the <a href="https://sakai.rutgers.edu/portal/site/c456b935-7e01-4a2b-8859-56ef0a1d4795">project page</a> in the Sakai system there. You should also find a version (named on the pattern boxer-*.zip) at the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/boxer-bayesian-regression/downloads/list">download
section</a> on our Google Code project.  Alternatively, you may be
reading this because someone has sent you a zip file on a CD or by
email.
</p>

<p>After you've downloaded the zip file, create a directory
named <tt>boxer-bayesian-regression</tt>, and unzip your zip file there:
<pre>
  mkdir boxer
  cd boxer
  mkdir boxer-bayesian-regression
  cd  boxer-bayesian-regression
  unzip  boxer-0_7_004.zip
</pre>

<h3>Compiling</h3>

<p>Place the Xerces jar file into the directory located at <tt>../lib</tt>, relative to <tt>boxer-bayesian-regression</tt>. That is, if you have
<tt>boxer/boxer-bayesian-regression</tt>, then the jar file should be placed into
<tt>boxer/lib</tt>. (If you already have that jar file living
elsewhere, and don't want to create an extra copy, you can just create
a symbolic link; or you can modify the classpath specified in
build.xml)</p>

<p>The directory <tt>boxer-bayesian-regression</tt> contains
file <tt>build.xml</tt> with instructions for compiling. To use it, simply type, in the directory <tt>boxer-bayesian-regression</tt>,
<pre>
    ant compile
</pre> 
If no errors have been reported, you'll have your code compiled to <pre>../classes</pre>

<p>You can also type
<pre>
    ant jar
</pre> 
to have a jar file, containing all the compiled code, built in the directory  <pre>../lib</pre>

<h3>Using</h3>
<p>
Once the Boxer and Borj code has been compiled, you can use it in the
same way as if you had downloaded the precompiled version (see
above). Just make sure that the <tt>classes</tt> directory (or the new
jar file, if you've built it) are in your classpath. 

<p>
You can find more specific usage examples in the documentation for <a href="../../borj/Driver.html">BORJ</a>.

<h2>David Lewis' plan</h2>
<p>
As per David Lewis' plan (December 2008):

<p>
One weakness of RCV1-v2 is that it doesn't have any multiclass or
polytomous category sets, i.e. sets of categories such that each
document belongs to exactly one category.  However, the Region
categories are nearly polytomous, and the Industry categories are what
one might call sub-polytomous (it's rare for a document to belong to
more than one Industry category, and many documents belong to none).

<p>
Therefore, in order to produce a single data set that we can use to
study both binary and polytomous classification, I suggest you do the
following:
<ol>
  <li> Discard all documents that contain 2+ Region categories and/or 2+
  Industry categories.

  <li> Add a category NoIndustry to the Industry field if the document
  does not have any Industry categories.  This will increase the
  defined number of Industry categories from 354 to 355, of which
  something less than 355 will be present in the data.

<p>
My guess is that this will still leave about 750000 documents.  The
data set will be somewhat unnatural, in that we will be throwing out
some of the more difficult documents.  But it seems worth it to have a
single large data set we can do both polytomous and binary experiments
on.

<p>
Since we're experimenting with online algorithms, the order in which
examples are processed is important, and we will want a reproducible
ordering of examples to work with.  However, since our focus is not on
concept drift we explicitly do NOT want a chronological order.  So
during this process add a new field RandIDa, to the documents.  Each
of the documents remaining after Step 2 should get a distinct random
ID between 000001 and the number of documents remaining after Step 2.

<p>
We'll reserve the 100000 documents with the last 100000 RandIDa IDs
for testing, and the others for training.  I suggest breaking the data
into a number of files small enough to be brought into your text
editor completely.  It always helps to be able to actually look at the
data files.

These instructions are included in the BOXER binary distribution
distributed under the name with the pattern
use-boxer-and-borj-*.*.*.zip (with the appropriate version number
instead of stars).

Unpacking this zip file has created a directory named
use-boxer-and-borj-*.*.* (with the appropriate version number instead
of stars), in which you would be reading this file. The compiled BOXER
and BORJ code is located in the file lib/boxer.jar; certain
third-party JAR files are also in the same subdirectory. The file
boxer.jar contains a manifest file that instructs the Java Virtual
Machine to add these thrid-party JAR files into the class path;
therefore, for the JVM to find them, all these JAR files must stay in
this directory.

To try using a BOXER application named BORJ, please go to the
directory tiny-sample and run the script named test.sh (on UNIX/Linux)
or test.bat on MS Windows. If it works, you know that all components
are in place.

You must have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE), or a similar Java
bytecode interpreter installed on your computer to run  BOXER application.
If you don't know what it is, please view  the documentation in
the file doc/html/installation.html  with your web browser.

For more information on BOXER and BORJ, please view the documentation in
the directory doc/html with your web browser.

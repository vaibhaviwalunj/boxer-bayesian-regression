All:

Attached is a sheet with a few hundred data points classed this way:

I set up 3 vectors (1,0,0) and the other two, i generated random
(uniform) components of vectors. I classified each according to which
of the unit vectors it had a larger inner product with.

So this is a classification that could be learned easily, and we can ask how the learner converges, what is the effect of eta, etc.

The input to TG is just

Col  value

A    case number

B    class number

C-F components of the feature vector (note that component 4 has no
effect on classification)

i think you can ignore all the rest.

<p>This is a placeholder for a (future) document describing all the
XML files that BOXER reads and writes.

<ul>
<li>Data sets
<li>Suites
<li>Feature dictionaries
<li>Learner description (just learner params, or a full model)
<li>A "learner complex", which includes a feature dictionary, a suite, and one or more learners using this suite.
</ul>

<p>For an overview of major BOXER XML elements,
see <a href="tags.html">tags.html</a>

<p>Boxer <a href="xerces.html">uses Xerces</a> to parse and generate XML.
